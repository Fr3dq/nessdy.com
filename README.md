Hi. The Nessdy is my first website which is for cerative and innovative people. Anyone who have crated an ambitios project can share it along others cerative people and supportive community. The website uses the Flask microframework, JavaScript, Python, Html and Css. (I hope it's obvious) It also runs on Gunicorn and Nginx (as a reverse proxy).
If you want to clone my repo go on, but remember not to post the same webside in the internet (nessdy.com rights are reserved)
